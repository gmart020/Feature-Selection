# Feature-Selection
Finds the subset of attributes that provide the highest accuracy amongst all subsets. The goal is to eliminate the number of attributes used to create a classification model. The accuracy of a subset is calculated by finding the number of correct classifications using the nearest neighbor to label the test object. Euclidean distance is used to measure the "distance" between two data objects.
